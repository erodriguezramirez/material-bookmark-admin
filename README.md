# Material Design Bookmark Admin

## DescriptionÂ 
Minimalist way to bookmark your favorites websites.

This project come up because I wanted to add something more visual and at the same time improve my skills with CSS and JavaScript, components were made using material design guidelines. Everything done from scratch without dependences or third party plugins, just old good CSS and Javascript.

## Usage example

Add new web pages clicking the plus button on each section, also you can edit the section name clicking the float button.

Don't worry about losing your data after close the browser! every change is saved using Local Storage
